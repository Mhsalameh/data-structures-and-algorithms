## Approach & Efficiency

- time complexity O(n)
- space complexity O(n)

## API

- function validateBrackets takes an expression as a string argument and returns false if the brackets are not balanced and true if the brackets are balanced.
- if the argument was not a string it will show an error inside the console log.
