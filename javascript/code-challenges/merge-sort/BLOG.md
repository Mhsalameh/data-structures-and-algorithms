# Merge Sort

The merge sort is one of the more advanced sorting algorithms thatâ€™s quite efficient in sorting large amounts of data. The algorithm uses the recursive function concept with divide and conquer strategy to efficiently sort a given list of elements.

## Pseudocode

```pseudo
ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n <-- arr.length

    if n > 1
      DECLARE mid <-- n/2
      DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
      DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
      // sort the left side
      Mergesort(left)
      // sort the right side
      Mergesort(right)
      // merge the sorted left and right sides together
      Merge(left, right, arr)

ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i <-- 0
    DECLARE j <-- 0
    DECLARE k <-- 0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            arr[k] <-- left[i]
            i <-- i + 1
        else
            arr[k] <-- right[j]
            j <-- j + 1

        k <-- k + 1

    if i = left.length
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left
```

## trace

Sample Array : `[8,23,4,42,16,15]`;

**phase 1:**

first we split the array into two halves until there is only one element in each array

```js
        [8,23,4,42,16,15]
     [8,23,4]  |  [42,16,15]
   [8]  [23,4] |   [42]  [16,15]
[8]  [23]  [4] |  [42]  [16]  [15]
```

**phase 2:**

we start merging two closest arrays. the smaller element is pushed to the new empty array thus sorting the array one step at a time.

```js
[8]  [23]  [4] |  [42]  [16]  [15]
   [8]  [4,23] |   [42]  [15,16]
     [4,8,23]  |  [15,16,42]
        [4,8,15,16,23,42]
```

## Efficency

- Time: O(n log(n))
  - we do multiple comparisons between two halfs of an array
- Space: O(n)
  - an array of n number of inputs was added
