# Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
## Challenge
Create a linkedList class that has 3 methods:
1. insert: insert a new node to the linked list.
2. includes: check if the linked list includes a value and return true if it's include and false if not.
3. toString: retun a string that shows the components of the linked list as 
## Approach & Efficiency
Big O -> time complexity O(1), Big O -> space complexity O(n)
## API
1. insert: insert a new node to the linked list.
2. includes: check if the linked list includes a value and return true if it's include and false if not.
3. toString: retun a string that shows the components of the linked list as
