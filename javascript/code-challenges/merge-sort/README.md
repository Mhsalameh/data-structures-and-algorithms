# Challenge Summary

The merge sort is one of the more advanced sorting algorithms thatâ€™s quite efficient in sorting large amounts of data. The algorithm uses the recursive function concept with divide and conquer strategy to efficiently sort a given list of elements.

## Solution

to run the function just call it with an unsorted array,

- mergeSort([4,5,8,9,75,1,0,18]) the returned value should be [0,1,4,5,8,9,18,75];

```javascript
console.log(mergeSort([4, 5, 8, 9, 75, 1, 0, 18]));
// output: [0,1,4,5,8,9,18,75]
```
